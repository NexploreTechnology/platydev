# Packages & Artifacts

Platyplus is designed to be as generic as possible, so it can be extended more easily, or even to reuse some of its bricks in other contexts:

- Helm charts
- Docker images

- [Tilt extensions](/docs/artifacts/tilt) to ease Hasura/Platyplus development on a Kubernets cluster
- Javascript packages such as:
  - an [JMESPath RxJS Operator](/docs/artifacts/js/rx-jmespath)
  - an [JMESPath RxDB plugin](/docs/artifacts/js/rxdb-plugin-jmespath)
  - a [Pulumi package](/docs/artifacts/js/pulumi) to quickly deploy a production-ready Digital Ocean cluster
